In one line, the [GitHub Student Developer Pack] is awesome! Among the many fabulous things it includes, I got $50 worth of [DigitalOcean] credits, which is what I've decided to use in the coming months to host Fleptic.

Currently Fleptic is being hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet (their fancy term for VPS) with 512MB RAM, 1 CPU core and 20GB harddisk space, running Fedora 24 x86_64. Apache is running the webserver and Jekyll is generating static webpages that I push using git.<!--break-->

I'm looking forward to learning a thing or two about maintaining a server now. :smile: I will write more blog posts later documenting about how I went about setting my site up on this VPS.

In case you're a student currently enrolled at a school/university, go and get your student pack from GitHub :wink:

**P.S.** I've already written a [new post](https://fleptic.eu/vps/jekyll/apache/fedora/2016/11/21/setup-your-personal-site-from-scratch-using-linux-apache-and-jekyll.html) detailing the process. Check it out! :wink:
