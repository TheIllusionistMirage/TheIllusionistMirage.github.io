title: About
---

Iâ€™m Koushtav Chakrabarty, a computer science & engineering undergrad at Asansol Engineering College, India. I like to think myself as a developer in progress who codes, procrastinates and then again codes a bit. I am an internet addict, spending hours aimlessly on Reddit and YouTube. Apart from those, TV/anime, movies and music are the drugs that keep me alive.

### Cirriculum Vitae

I'm open to job opportunities and internships. Please find my CV [here](koushtav-chakrabarty-resume.pdf).
