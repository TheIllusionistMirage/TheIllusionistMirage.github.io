Simple Brainfuck Interpreter is an interpreter for the esolang,
[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), created by Urban MÃ¼ller.

### What is Brainfuck?

Like I already said, Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language, meaning it was
desgined to test the boundaries of computer science and also make programmers bang
their heads on their desks.

The language is noted for its _extreme minimalism_. Brainfuck contains an `instruction pointer`,
a `data pointer` and just `eight commands`. It is assumed that there are infinite data cells of
1 byte each. The breakdown of these eight commands is as follows:

| Command |                             What it does                               |
| :-----: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         |                                                                        |
| `>`     | Increments the `data pointer` (to point to the next cell)              |
|         |                                                                        |
| `<`     | Decrements the `data pointer` (to point to previous cell)              |
|         |                                                                        |
| `+`     | Increments the value pointed to by `data pointer`                      |
|         |                                                                        |
| `-`     | Decrements the value pointed to by `data pointer`                      |
|         |                                                                        |
| `.`     | Print the value pointed to by `data pointer`                           |
|         |                                                                        |
| `,`     | Accept 1 byte of input and store it the cell pointer by `data pointer` |
|         |                                                                        |
| `[`     | Beginning of a `while` loop. If a `[` is encountered and the value     |
|         | pointed by the `data pointer` is 0, then the `instruction pointer` is  |
|         | moved forward to the instruction just after the macthing `]`           |
|         |                                                                        |
| `]`     | End of a `while` loop. If a `]` is encountered and the value pointed   |
|         | by the `data pointer` is non-zero, then the `instruction pointer` is   | 
|         | moved backwards to the instruction just after the macthing `[`         |

The C/C++ equivalent of these commands are:

|  Command  |         C/C++ equivalent        |
| :-------: | ------------------------------- |
|           |                                 |
|  _Start_  | `char data[INFINITY] = { 0 };`  |
|           | `char* ip = data;`              |
| `>`       | `++ip;`                         |
| `<`       | `--ip;`                         |
| `+`       | `++(*ip);`                      |
| `-`       | `--(*ip);`                      |
| `.`       | `putchar(*ip);`                 |
| `,`       | `*ip = getchar();`              |
| `[`       | `while (*ip) {`                 |
| `]`       | `}`                             |

NOTE : Ideal value for `INFINITY` is `30000` in most brainfuck
interpreters.

### Source, Building & Running
 
You can find the source of Simple Brainfuck Interpreter
[here](https://github.com/TheIllusionistMirage/Simple-Brainfuck-Interpreter).

Build & run:

```
$ g++ *.cpp -o s-bfck-i
$ ./s-bfck-i TowersOfHanoi.bf
```

You can try the two brainfuck sources called `HelloWorld.bf` and
`TowersOfHanoi.bf` included in the repo.
